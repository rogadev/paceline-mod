# Notes: the mods platform and how paceline uses it

What we learned while building v0.1.0 on Claude Code 2.1.296 (2026-10-11). The mods API is early access and changes between releases: when something here disagrees with the types the engine writes to `.claude-plugin/types/claude-code/index.d.ts`, the types win. Update this file when you find out.

## Why a mod, and why TypeScript

- A mod is a plugin whose `hooks/hooks.json` names a hooks module that exports `register(on)`. Claude Code runs it in its own process, in an environment with **no Node and no DOM**: only JavaScript or TypeScript, and everything outside the module goes through `$`. Go can't run inside a mod. The only way to reuse the Go binary would be to start it with `$.process.run` on every refresh, which would mean two installs and a process per redraw, so the logic was ported instead.
- Mods need Claude Code v2.1.287 or later. They draw in the terminal and in the Desktop app's Code tab. Hooks also run, without drawing, in the VS Code chat panel, `claude -p`, and the Agent SDK.
- A mod runs with the user's permissions and isn't sandboxed. That's unrelated to bypass-permissions mode: paceline needs no permission mode at all.

## Where paceline can draw

- **A plugin can't set the status line.** The manifest's `settings` key accepts only `agent` and `subagentStatusLine`, and the status line isn't a render site. The Go paceline keeps that slot, and the two can run side by side.
- **`$.ui.status(text)` doesn't work for the line.** Tested: it draws a plain-text notice under the prompt, shows ANSI escapes as garbage (`�[32m`), and the engine puts a warning glyph and the plugin's name in front. It's meant for short notices.
- **The `AbovePrompt` band works.** Tested: `Text` takes `color` as a hex string (`'#c792ea'`) or a theme key (`'warning'`, `'error'`). **`dimColor: true` and the `inactive` theme key both draw as plain text there**, far brighter than the Go line's ANSI dim, so `src/band.ts` draws dim parts in a fixed gray (`#767676`). It comes out slightly lighter than the Go line's dim; a darker gray is a one-line change. The terminal draws named colors (`'green'`, `'cyan'`, `'yellow'`) in its own palette, the same as the Go line's ANSI codes. The band shows a `[-]` collapse mark at its right edge (Ctrl+X Ctrl+A also collapses it), and other mods can draw there too. `src/band.ts` keeps what later mods draw by putting `await next(e)` under the line.
- A `Box` with `flexWrap: 'wrap'` around one `flexShrink: 0` Box per segment wraps whole segments onto the next row in a narrow window.
- Other places a mod can draw: a pane (`$.ui.open`, docked beside the transcript in a wide fullscreen terminal; a pane opened unasked waits for 144 columns), toasts (`$.ui.toast`), and restyling Claude Code's own sites (`Spinner`, `PromptHint`, messages, tool rows).

## Where each figure comes from

The Go paceline reads the status line JSON on stdin. The mod rebuilds the same payload shape from the API (`src/live.ts`), so `src/render.ts` runs unchanged:

| Payload field | Mod source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `model.display_name` | `$.session.model()` | Returns the raw ID (`claude-opus-5-5`), not the display name. `src/model.ts` maps it. |
| `effort.level` | `e.effort.level` on `classic.PostToolUse` and `classic.Stop`, skipping events that carry `agent_id` | No API reading. Falls back to `effortLevel` from `$.settings.read()` until the first turn. See [Effort lags a `/effort` change](#effort-lags-a-effort-change). |
| `fast_mode` | `$.settings.read().fastMode` | Unverified: no API exposes fast mode, and this key may not be where Claude Code keeps it. |
| `workspace.current_dir`, `project_dir` | `$.session.cwd()`, `$.session.root()` | |
| `rate_limits` | `$.session.usage().rateLimits` | `{ kind: 'five_hour' | 'seven_day', percentUsed, resetsAt }`, with `resetsAt` as an ISO string. Empty off a subscription. The test showed these match the Go line exactly. |
| `context_window.used_percentage` | `$.session.usage().context.percent` | |
| `cost.total_duration_ms` | `$.clock.now() - usage.startedAt` | `startedAt` is the first launch for a resumed session. |
| `prompt_cache` | not available | No `cache cold` segment yet. The `model.switch` event carries `cache_ttl` (`'5m'` or `'1h'`) and `prompt_cache_warm`, and `classic.SessionStart` on resume carries `prompt_cache_likely_expired`, so an estimate (last response time plus TTL) may be possible. |
| git branch | `.git/HEAD` read with `$.fs` | `$.session.repo()` has no branch field. |
| HEAD and origin/main shas | the ref files, then `packed-refs`, read with `$.fs` | In a linked worktree, branches, remotes, and `packed-refs` live in the common git dir that the worktree's `commondir` file names; `HEAD` stays in the worktree's own git dir. `src/gitinfo.ts` follows both. |
| `/orc-loop` state | `<git dir>/orc-loop/state.json` read with `$.fs` | The worktree's own git dir, where orc-loop writes it. Stat first, capped at 256 KiB. |
| review batch | `git` through `$.process.run`, and `tmp/reviews/ledger.jsonl` | See [Running git for the batch segment](#running-git-for-the-batch-segment). |

`session.measure` fires after each main-thread turn and whenever a rate-limit window moves a whole point. That plus a 15-second timer drives refreshes.

### Effort lags a `/effort` change

- **Subagent events are ignored.** An event with an `agent_id` comes from a subagent, and its `effort.level` is the subagent's own (orc dispatches agents at `low` or `high`), not the main thread's. `turnEffort` in `src/live.ts` returns the cached level for those events and for events with no `effort`.
- **`classic.PreToolUse` can't serve as a source.** The settings-hook input for `PreToolUse` carries `effort`, but a module hook's event there is `ToolCallEnvelope` (`ClassicEventOf` in the engine's types), which has no `effort` and no `agent_id`. So the level changes only when a main-thread tool finishes or a turn stops, and a `/effort` change shows after the next tool completes.
- **Open on #10:** whether `classic.PreToolUse`'s runtime `e` carries `effort` despite its type. Check it live before building on it.

## Validator and runtime rules

- `claude plugin validate` follows `$` only into functions declared at the top level of the hooks module: never across an import, and never into an arbitrary closure. This is why every `$` call is in `hooks/register.ts`.
- A hook on an event that can refuse something (`tool.call`, `classic.*`, and others) is listed as a gating hook. Watch-only hooks there get `.catch(($, e, next) => next(e))`.
- `$.fs.read` rejects files over 4 MiB. Stat first and cap smaller files yourself.
- `$.store` is one JSON file per plugin under `~/.claude/plugins/store/`, shared by every session on the machine; a get then set isn't atomic. `$.state` holds values for the session, survives hot reloads, redraws its readers when written, and resets on `/clear`, `/resume`, and `/branch`.
- Test environment: `claude plugin test` runs `*.test.ts` files with `test`, `expect`, and `describe` from `claude-code/testing`. Local time and `Intl` work there; fs, network, and processes don't.

## Running git for the batch segment

Decided for #2 (2026-10-19). Everything else in the mod reads files and starts no process. The batch segment does run git: the commit and issue counts and the "review stale (+2 commits)" check need history, which ref files alone can't give. The exception is kept narrow:

- **Gated.** git runs only when `segments.batch` is on, the host environment sets neither `GIT_DIR` nor `GIT_WORK_TREE`, the work tree has `.claude/skills/deep-review/scripts/ledger.mjs` (checked first, so a repository without deep-review costs one stat), HEAD is on a branch other than `main` that has a commit, and `refs/remotes/origin/main` resolves. Every check is a file read or an environment read. Outside such repos, no process starts.
- **Fixed argument lists, shas only.** `git -C <work tree> --no-lazy-fetch -c core.fsmonitor=false`, then `merge-base <origin/main> <HEAD>`, `log --no-show-signature --max-count=999 --format=%x00%B <base>..<HEAD>`, or `rev-list --count <reviewed>^{commit}..<HEAD>`. Every revision is a sha that passed a hex check, so nothing from the repository can read as an option or a revision expression. `--no-show-signature` keeps a repository's `log.showSignature` from starting its `gpg.program`. The fsmonitor pin is defense in depth, because none of these commands read the index. The argument lists, and the rules for what each result means, are built in `src/batch.ts` and tested there.
- **git finds the repository itself.** The mod never sets `GIT_DIR` or `GIT_WORK_TREE`, because an explicit `GIT_DIR` skips git's `safe.directory` ownership check: a `.git` planted by another user above a folder that isn't a repository would otherwise have its config loaded. With `-C <work tree>`, git runs its own discovery and ownership check, so such a repository exits 128 and the segment shows nothing. A host that sets either variable skips the segment, since git would follow the variable instead of the work tree. Other host git variables, such as `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY`, still pass through, because `env` adds to the host environment and can't unset a variable. They are only ever set on purpose, and git only reads here.
- **A working folder the repository doesn't control.** git runs with its working folder set to the Claude config folder, not the work tree, so a `git` executable committed to the repository can't be found ahead of the real one on Windows. If the config folder isn't an absolute path, the segment is skipped. A drive-letter (`C:/`) or UNC (`//server/share`) path counts on any host. A path rooted at `/` counts only off Windows, because on Windows it is relative to the current drive. The engine doesn't report the platform, so a set `USERPROFILE` stands in for Windows (`batchAllowed` in `src/batch.ts`).
- **No lazy fetches.** A partial clone's `git log` could otherwise fetch missing objects over the network, a path to running code. The global `--no-lazy-fetch` option (git 2.45 and later, per its release notes) stops it, and a git too old to know the option exits 129, so the segment fails closed. `GIT_NO_LAZY_FETCH=1` is also set.
- **Hooks off, short timeout.** `$.process.run` runs git with repository hooks off. Each call gets 1.5 seconds. A `git log` whose output passes the 4 MiB stdout cap counts as no batch.
- **Cached, and never in the way.** The results are cached in module state under a key of the work tree, the HEAD and origin/main shas, and the ledger's mtime and size, all read without a process. git runs again only when that key changes. The git calls never hold a refresh: a refresh draws the cached batch (or none) and starts a background update. The update redraws when it settles, and it keeps its result only if its key is still the latest one asked for. A non-zero exit is kept until the key changes. A timeout, or a git that won't start, is tried again after a minute.
- **Per session.** The cache isn't in `$.store`. Each open session in a repo runs these calls once per key change, which is cheap, and keeping the store free of per-repository entries avoids its non-atomic get-then-set. A hot reload empties the cache, which costs one recompute.

## The limit forecast

The line warns about at most one of `s` and `w`, chosen in `src/forecast.ts`. The user asked for it on 2026-10-11: determine which limit runs out first and show only that one, to cut noise, keeping in mind 9-to-5 users, agents running 24/7, API-key users, and Max-plan users staying under their limits.

- **Activity profile.** Each refresh marks the local hour as seen, and as active if either limit's usage rose since the last reading (a drop is a reset, not use). Per hour of the day, the chance of working is `(active days + 0.25) / (completed days + 0.5)`: 0.5 with no history, about 0.97 or 0.03 after a week of steady use. Weekdays and weekends share one profile in v1.
- **Rates.** Week: points spent today (from the day snapshot) over today's active hours, once there are 2 or more; else the week's points over the week's active hours; else the week's points over half its elapsed hours (at least 3). Session: its points over the active hours in its five-hour window, or its elapsed time when none are recorded.
- **Projection.** Step 15 minutes at a time from now to each reset, burning `rate × chance`. The next hour counts as certain while usage rose in the last 20 minutes.
- **Pick.** The limit that runs out first; if neither does, the one forecast to end its window fuller, keeping the previous pick when the two are within 5 points.
- **Display.** The pick shows only when it has an out time, that is, when it runs out before it resets: `w→Tue 10pm` or `s→3:45pm`, with no percentage. A pick without an out time draws nothing. The out time rounds down, to the hour for the week and to the quarter hour for the session, with `floorInDay` in `src/timefmt.ts`, which counts steps from the local start of the day so a half-hour-offset zone keeps its own hours. If the rounded time is already before now, the exact minute shows instead. A week warning is yellow until it's within 24 hours of running out, then red; a session warning is always red. With `"limits": "both"` there is no pick, and the line shows both percentages after the today bar.
- **Gaps.** Usage on another device while the mod isn't running lands in the hour of the next reading. Time zones with half-hour offsets bucket hours on UTC hour boundaries. API-key users have no rate limits, so there's nothing to forecast; a cost forecast for them is a separate idea.

## Ideas not built yet

- **Toast when today's budget runs out**, from `session.measure`. Only a mod can do this.
- **`/paceline` command** to change the style, segments, or count direction without editing `paceline.json`. Register it in `session.start` with `$.command.register`.
- **A history pane**: day-by-day usage kept in `$.store`, drawn with `Raster` for a sparkline in the terminal.
- **Built-in budget and progress tools** with `$.tool.register`, replacing `paceline-mcp`. A plugin named `paceline` gets tool names `mcp__paceline__<name>`, the same as the MCP server's today, so agents and orc-pack keep working. Users must not run both at once.
- **The prompt-cache warning**, from the events above.
- **CI** that installs Claude Code and runs `validate` and `test`.
