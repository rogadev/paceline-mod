/**
 * Forecasts which usage limit runs out first, the five-hour session or the
 * week. The compact line turns the pick into a warning only when it runs out
 * before it resets; otherwise it shows neither limit.
 *
 * The model:
 *
 * - Activity: each refresh marks the local hour of the day in which usage
 *   went up. Over the recorded days that gives, per hour of the day, the
 *   chance the user is working then: a 9-to-5 user is near 1 during work
 *   hours and near 0 at night, an agent running around the clock is near 1
 *   everywhere. With no history yet, every hour is an even chance.
 * - Burn rate: percentage points per active hour. The week uses today's
 *   average (points spent today over today's active hours), falling back to
 *   the week's average early in the day. The session uses its own window.
 * - Projection: walk forward from now to the limit's reset, adding the burn
 *   rate times the chance of working in each stretch, and note when the
 *   limit would reach 100%.
 *
 * Every function here is pure: the activity record lives in the mod's store,
 * and hooks/register.ts reads and writes it.
