 * when it is a commit id, reduces the verdict to the values the segment tells
 * apart, and clamps the counts, so no string from the file reaches the line.

 * argument lists and cache key, turns git's results into the segment's state,
 * and decides when the cached state is drawn or recomputed. hooks/register.ts
 * runs the git calls and holds the cache; docs/notes.md records why git runs
